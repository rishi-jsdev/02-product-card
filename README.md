## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- BEM
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the 'strech' property in flexbox to fill and image in row direction.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.product__image {
  width: 50%;
  height: auto;
  background: no-repeat url("./images/image-product-desktop.jpg");
  align-self: stretch;
  background-size: cover;
}
```

### Continued development

I hope to use SASS preoprocessor in the next challenge.
